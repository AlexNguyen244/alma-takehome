# Design Decisions

## Front End
I selected React as the front-end JavaScript library and TailwindCSS for styling. These tools allowed me to rapidly develop the frontend leveraging ChatGPT to effectively showcase the backend’s features.

## Back End
This was my first time using FastAPI, but I quickly grasped the framework thanks to my prior experience with Python and backend development. Previously, I had built backends using Node.js and Express.js, and I found FastAPI easier to work with, particularly because it integrates seamlessly with other Python tools, such as the Gmail API. For this project, I learned Alembic to manage database migrations efficiently and applied Docker to containerize both the frontend and backend services, building on the foundational knowledge I had acquired previously.

### Email
I implemented email alerts using the Gmail API with my own Google Cloud credentials. I chose this approach due to my prior experience with the Gmail API, which enabled me to implement the feature quickly and efficiently. The notification sender is stored in the `EMAIL_SENDER` variable, while emails can be sent to both a prospect and an attorney using the `PROSPECT_EMAIL` and `ATTORNEY_EMAIL` variables. The prospect’s email is placed in the `To` field, and the attorney’s email is included in the `Cc` field.

### Authentication & Authorization
Authentication is handled using the Google OAuth API, which securely verifies a user’s identity when they log in.
Authorization is role-based:
- When a new user logs in for the first time, their email is stored in the database with the default role of `user`.
- The user role currently has the same access level as the public (no additional privileges). However, emails are logged in the database for auditing and tracking purposes.
- To grant administrative privileges, the role must be manually updated in the database to `admin`.
- Users with the admin role gain access to restricted pages such as View Leads.

### Database
The PostgreSQL database consists of two primary tables: `users` and `leads`.
- `users` table
    - Stores authentication and authorization data for logged-in users.
    - Each entry contains the user’s email and role (e.g., user or admin).
    - By default, new logins are assigned the user role. This provides the same access level as the public, but the user’s information is stored for logging and auditing purposes.
- `leads` table
    - Stores lead-related information including first name, last name, email, and state.
    - Each lead entry is assigned a unique ID, generated by combining:
        - The portion of the email before the @ symbol.
        - A timestamp.
    - This approach ensures that IDs are unique across all entries.

### Filesystem
The local computer works as the file storage system for all lead resumes. Each PDF is named using the portion of the email before the @ symbol combined with a timestamp, ensuring a unique filename. This approach allows the frontend to reliably display the PDF when the user clicks the "View" button.
